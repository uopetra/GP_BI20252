## How to Use This Template

This repository serves as a **template for Business Intelligence graduation projects**. Students should **fork this repository** and use it as the foundation for their project work. All project-related files and documentation should be organized within this single repository.

### For Students: Quick Start
1. **Fork this repository** to create your own copy
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Follow the sections below** to structure your project documentation in markdown format
4. **Push your work** regularly to track progress

## Documentation Best Practices

✅ **Do's:**
- Write in clear, professional language
- Use consistent formatting and headings
- Include visuals (charts, screenshots, diagrams)
- Add links to your data sources and tools
- Update regularly as your project evolves
- Use version control (git commits with meaningful messages)

❌ **Don'ts:**
- Don't use Word documents – use Markdown (.md) for version control
- Don't commit large data files directly – use `.gitignore` and reference external sources
- Don't leave sections incomplete – mark as TODO if not ready
- Don't forget to document your data sources and methodology
